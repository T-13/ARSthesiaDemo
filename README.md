# ARSthesiaDemo

Demonstration scene and sequencer cinematic project built in [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com) for ARSthesia prototype multimedia system project at Multimedia, showcasing how wearing Augmented Reality glasses powered by ARSthesia would look and feel like.

Exported cinematic was additionally edited by [@Nevith](https://github.com/Nevith) and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/) (TBA/WIP). It includes added effects, sounds and results and forms a finalized product pitch video.

First person camera used for the cinematic is part of the ARSthesia character. There is also a secondary camera following the character around in third person for having a laugh at solely first person animation design.
